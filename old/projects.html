				</h2>
				<p>
					Conceived by the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and
					Fisheries (DG MARE) of the European Commission, the project focuses
					on the establishment of a single information system for fishery and
					aquaculture products marketed in the European Union. The
					information system, available as a fully operational multilingual
					prototype, aims at providing different stakeholders (consumers,
					producers, fishmongers, processors, importers, retailers, control
					authorities and other interested parties) with heterogeneous
					information related to commercial designations of fishery and
					aquaculture products put on the market in the EU Member States.
					MARE combines a solid taxonomic and nomenclatural backbone for
					aquatic species and their scientific names with commercial
					designations published by each Member State's national authorities
					in accordance with EU regulations. This core information is
					complemented with heterogeneous data that include, among the
					others, production methods, fishing gears, fishing areas, marketing
					standards, quality certification schemes, fishing opportunities and
					species distribution. <br /> <span

					<span class="icon-large icon-bank"></span> Neptis
				</h2>
				<p>NEPTIS focuses on cultural experience and cultural heritage exploitation defining and realizing CONCEPTOURING (from concept to cultural experience-oriented tour engineering), an integrated system prototype to create services and applications supporting itineraries and cultural heritage exploitation. These itineraries will offer an assisted access to citizens, tourists and visitors and a cultural heritage personalized experience before, during and after their visit.
The NEPTIS system is a type of authoring collaborative and web-based system, that could be used by operators (and user) to build multimedia, interactive, dynamic, adaptive, personalisez/user-adjustable and exciting cultural itineraries. The itineraries will be experienced with personal mobile devices (smartphone, tablet) and/or made available directly on cultural site (mainly on tablet)
The system adopts a collaborative approach to support the co-creation of contents and services based on co- operation among cultural stakeholders, in order to. The project, actually, aims to create a model of engagement of the Cultural Heritage sector.
Applications built trough CONCEPTOURING can exploit the interaction user/visitor (on-site, on-line, on remote control) through physical real itineraries (3D scenic design, immersive media, single/multiple fruition), navigation/exploration of virtually rebuilt environment both terrestrial and underwater (remote control, limited immersion, single/multiple fruition), learning itineraries and knowledge based on the employment of mobile devices such as smartphone and tablet (development/divulgation).
The validation of project results will take place on many of the following sites/itineraries/sceneries of Sicilian territory: Museo del barocco and Val di Noto circuit, Eraclea Minoa archaeological and antiquarium Site, Liberty with Basile archive and Villino Ida Basile, Augusta Castel , Sicilian Cathedral Tour, Priolo Gargallo territory. It is also expected an experimentation of virtual underwater sites fruition.<br /> <span

					<span class="icon-large icon-bank"></span> ArCo
				</h2>
				<p>ArCo is an initiative of the ICCD (Istituto Centrale per il Catalogo e la Documentazione) and the CNR (Italian National Research Council), as part of the project dati.beniculturali.it, for cultural heritage enhancement through the publication of LOD.

ArCo aims at making available data from the Catalogo generale dei beni culturali following the paradigm of the Linked Data initiative, in an open format, in order to ensure accessibility to users and interoperability.

The main activities of the project will include:

    the definition of a network of ontologies for representing the informations contained in the general catalogue, in relation to different types of cultural objects, taking into account the actual ICCD standards
    the publication of the data processed in the SiGeC (Sistema Generale del Catalogo, following the Linked Open Data principles, to populate the MiBACT SDL (semantic digital library).
    the building of a constant dialogue and a cooperation with private and public actors, who want to be early adopters.

All releases of the project will be published on GitHub.<br /> <span
